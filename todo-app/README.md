# TODO app

## Goal
Implement a node app to manage the list of things to do.

## User Stories to implement

#### Help
    As a first timer user
    I want to have access to the help,
    so that I know how interact with the app

#### Add task
    As a user
    I want to add a task to do
    so I will have a reminder to do it

#### Retrieve TODO tasks
    As a user
    I want to retrieve the list of pending tasks
    so I can remember which task I have to work on

#### Mark task as done
    As a user
    I want to mark one pending task as done
    so I don't have to worry about that task anymore

#### Try to mark non existing task as done
    As a user
    I want to receive a friendly error message
    when I try to mark as done a non existing task
    so I understand the problem and I will be able to fix the invalid arguments

## Non functional requirements

#### Output format
    As a User Experience person
    I want to show the information in a pretty way
    so our users interact with our app easily

#### Persisting information
    As a technical lead
    I want to have no dependencies with a database
    so I don't have to worry about when deploy the app in a server

#### Tests
    As a technical lead
    I want, at least, one test by User Story
    to ensure that our software has low defects
    so we will have happy users

#### Tracking the history
    As a technical lead
    I want to keep track on the progress on GIT
    so we can understand the reasons behind each line of code
