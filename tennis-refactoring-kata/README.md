## Goal
- Refactor the code to reduce the complexity and improve the readability

## Tennis rules
You can read more about Tennis scores here which is summarized below:

- A game is won by the first player to have won at least four points in total and at least two points more than the opponent.
- The running score of each game is described in a manner peculiar to tennis: scores from zero to three points are described as "Love", "Fifteen", "Thirty", and "Forty" respectively.
- If at least three points have been scored by each player, and the scores are equal, the score is "Deuce".
- If at least three points have been scored by each side and a player has one more point than his opponent, the score of the game is "Advantage" for the player in the lead.
